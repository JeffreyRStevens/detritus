<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of detritus is to include miscellaneous functions that I need
to use across projects.

## Installation

You can install the development version of detritus from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JeffreyRStevens/detritus")
```
